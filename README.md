# Frontend Mentor - Tip Calculator App Solution

This project, the "Tip Calculator App", was created as a frontend practice exercise to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
The idea behind this project came from a challenge provided by Frontend Mentor, a platform that offers design challenges to improve frontend development skills.<br>
The main objective was to build an interactive app that allows users to calculate tip and total amounts per person based on the bill, tip percentage, and number of people.
